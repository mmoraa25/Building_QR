# Mobile application of registry information for urban planning context with Augmented Reality and QR codes

This work presents a prototype of a mobile application for obtaining registry information of houses, through augmented reality and QR codes. It consists of the development of a tool for the generation of authorized public information on housing in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, in an interactive way using a combination of new technologies as a management strategy in the context of urban planning.

The incorporation of the informative components, specifically regarding the identification of the property or land registry, and the need for the official presentation allowed by the regulatory body for viewing on the mobile device, has allowed a first prototype called "Building QR".

The application allows the user to observe the representation of a house can be seen when scanning the QR code corresponding to that property. The information shown on the side of the 3D model shows the owner's name, location, parish, property code, real estate registration number and latitude and longitude coordinates.

This mobile application as an informative and interactive tool in the context of urban planning that can be used by land, cadastre and land registry personnel of the Guayaquil canton, Guayas province, as well as homeowners in the urban sector.

By implementing the mobile application, time will be saved for the collaborators of the three departments, since the information gathering process could be done in a faster way, by visualizing the exact information of the properties. In addition, errors and conflicts between the departments that handle this type of information are avoided.

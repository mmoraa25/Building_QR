<h1 align="justify">Mobile application of registry information for urban planning context with Augmented Reality and QR codes.</h1>

<p align="justify">
This work presents a prototype of a mobile application for obtaining registry information of houses, through augmented reality and QR codes. It consists of the development of a tool for the generation of authorized public information on housing in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, in an interactive way using a combination of new technologies as a management strategy in the context of urban planning. </p>
<p align="justify">
The incorporation of the informative components, specifically regarding the identification of the property or land registry, and the need for the official presentation allowed by the regulatory body for viewing on the mobile device, has allowed a first prototype called "Building QR".</p>
<p align="justify">
The application allows the user to observe the representation of a house can be seen when scanning the QR code corresponding to that property. The information shown on the side of the 3D model shows the owner's name, location, parish, property code, real estate registration number and latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>
<p align="justify">
This mobile application as an informative and interactive tool in the context of urban planning that can be used by land, cadastre and land registry personnel of the Guayaquil canton, Guayas province, as well as homeowners in the urban sector.</p>
<p align="justify">
By implementing the mobile application, time will be saved for the collaborators of the three departments, since the information gathering process could be done in a faster way, by visualizing the exact information of the properties. In addition, errors and conflicts between the departments that handle this type of information are avoided. </p> 
<p align="justify">
The mobile application can be downloaded from the following website: https://github.com/mmoraa25/Building_QR.git</p>

<h2 align="justify">Traditional way</h2>   
<p align="justify">
When it comes to collecting information on lots, they must do it manually, opening the possibility of errors in the subsequent registration of such lots, for example, when they are registered as available lots when in fact they do have owners, which causes conflicts with the Land Registry department; or when two cadastral codes are assigned for a single property.</p>

<p align="justify">
The representation of the QR code in the homes is captured by the application , where each property has a unique QR code assigned to a part of the property that is easily accessible to the cadastre staff, so that they can scan the QR code from their cell phones, using an application that activates them and shows them a 3D model of the property with all the information they need to know. </p>
<p align="justify">
The user interacts with the application through a mobile device. Within the application, the QR code is processed once the QR code is captured, the application recognizes the code from among those stored in the database, then interprets the pattern and displays the scene associated with that pattern on the screen. </p>
<p align="justify">
In a survey conducted, the participants were asked if they would recommend the use of the Building QR application for the management of urban cadastral information, obtaining that 95% would say "yes, I would recommend it" and 5% responded that "I would not recommend it", which shows the percentage of satisfaction with the prototype in its first versión.</p>

Respondents were also asked if they agree that technologies such as augmented reality, can help in the management of the digitization of cadastral information of dwellings, 66% of respondents indicated that they were “strongly agree”, 27% of indicating to be “agree”, 6% to indicate “neither agree nor disagree” and 1% of being “in disagreement”. This shows a total acceptance rate of 93% of the population. </p>

<p align="justify">
The participants were asked about the visual information content observed in the application, specifically, do you think this information is important for urban information management? 58% of the participants thought it was important for the management of urban information, 58% of the participants thought it was “very important”, 32% thought it was "important", 8% thought it was "something important", 1% thought it was "less important" and 1% thought it was "nothing important". This shows the level of importance that the population gives to the cadastral information of the dwellings. A total of 90% believe that this information is important.</p>
